## What is BESH?

**BESH** is a livestream-native Web3 platform that turns real-time content into interactive, participatory, and on-chain experiences.

BESH emphasizes **live-first mechanics** - enabling creators and communities to drive engagement, coordination, and value during the stream, not afterward.

Instead of passive watching, BESH enables:
- Live token launches and creator drops
- Real-time viewer participation via on-chain actions
- Instant social and economic momentum
- Community-driven coordination

Built for low latency, high speed, and live-native markets on Solana.

---

## Core Features

- **Livestream Launchpad**  
  Launch on-chain experiences such as tokens and drops directly from live streams.

- **Real-Time Participation**  
  Viewers interact instantly with on-chain mechanics during the broadcast.

- **Solana-Powered**  
  Fast finality, low fees, and high scalability.

- **Creator-First Design**  
  Built around streamers and live dynamics, not static feeds.

---

## Example: Launch a Token via BESH (using Bags.fm SDK)

BESH integrates with **Bags.fm** to enable fast, livestream-native token launches.

Install the SDK:

```bash
npm install @bagsfm/bags-sdk @solana/web3.js dotenv bs58

```
